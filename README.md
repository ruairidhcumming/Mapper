# Mapper
scripts for map generation project
The purpose of this project is to develop tools for simultaneous location and mapping (SLAM) using a (video) image input.

# Techniques 
the current model uses a modified Pix2Pix GAN model from Keras-GAN and dependent functions from Keras-Contrib 
the input image is generated in Unity. I will add unity scripts/assets/exe at a later date if there is interest. currently they are spread across my other repos and local machine :( 

# Input Example 
This is an example of the input image generated from Unity

# Results
